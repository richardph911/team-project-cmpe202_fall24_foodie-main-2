### Sprint Notes

Meeting every MWF

1. Sprint Meeting 1 (09/20):
   We planned to split the app into 2 parts: front end interface (ReactJS) and backend API(Java Spring Boot). We decided to start with some UI designs on Figma and set up the project including dependiences and tools.

2. Sprint Meeting 2 (09/23, 25, 27):
   On this sprint, we focus on designing the rest of the system and start implementing basic functions for the front end and back end.

3. Sprint Meeting 3 (09/30, 10/2, 4):
   Sprint 3 we focus on setting authentication UI page and homepage, continuing setting up the backend and a few API endpoints so the frontend can call and integrate with the backend. More business rules and user models are created.
